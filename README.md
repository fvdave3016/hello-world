# hello-world
Just creating another project

Hello this is Everett.  I am a computer person that up until now has mainly worked with the hardware side of computers and othere IoT items.  I am branching out into programming and have found this web site called GrtHub.  I do not really know what to expect from this web site but so far it has been pretty straight forward.
